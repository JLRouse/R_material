# R_material
### Some R learning materials I have written over the years. Most are basic R but provide a good basis for beginners and I include a lot of further links to more accomplished R users.

####
1) Introduction to R
2) Introduction to dpylr
3) Visualisation
4) Statistical analysis
5) Using R for Data Science
