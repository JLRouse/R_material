# R_material

###
Some R learning materials I have written over the years. Most are basic R but provide a good basis for beginners and I include a lot of further links to more accomplished R users.

####
The layout of the materials see them split into 5 areas. All have R scipts and powerpoints that should provide a general overview. Dataframes that have been referenced during the scipts can be found in the folder dataframes.

1) Introduction to R
2) Introduction to dpylr
3) Visualisation
4) Using R for Data Science
5) Reproducible analysis (rmarkdown)
